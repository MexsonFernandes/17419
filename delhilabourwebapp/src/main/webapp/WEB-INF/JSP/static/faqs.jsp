                        Paying points is a way to reduce your interest rate when you purchase or refinance your home. You are paying points up front to get a reduction on your interest rate to reduce your monthly payment over the life of your loan term. One point is equivalent to one percent of your loan amount, one point on a $100,000 loan amount is equal to $1,000.
                        As a general rule of thumb it really doesnâ€™t make sense to pay over 1% or 1-1/2% in points to reduce your interest rate.

                        Loan to Value refers to the amount of the loan as a percentage of the current market value of your home. You can calculate your LTV fairly by dividing your existing loan amount by current value of your home. If you borrow $100,000 and your home is worth $200,000 your loan to value is 50%. This is an extremely important calculation in the mortgage underwriting process. If your loan to value exceeds 80% you will be required to pay PMI. See PMI.

                        The Annual Percentage Rate, which must be reported by lenders under the Fair Truth in Lending regulations. It is a measure of credit cost to the borrower that takes account of the interest rate, points, and flat dollar charges by the lender. The charges covered by the APR also include mortgage insurance premiums, but no other payments to third parties, such as payments to title insurers or appraisers. The APR is adjusted for the time value of money so that dollars paid by the borrower up-front carry a heavier weight than dollars paid in the future. However, the APR is calculated on the assumption that the loan runs to term, and is therefore potentially deceptive for borrowers with short time horizons.

The Federal Housing Administration is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). FHA insures loans made to all U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and noncitizens with work permits who meet their financial qualification rules. Under an FHA program, if the buyer defaults on their mortgage and the lender foreclose, the FHA pays 100% of the amount insured. This loan insurance lets qualified people buy affordable houses. FHA will allow for only 3% down this means if you have a $100,000 purchase of a house you will only be required to put down $3,000. This does NOT include closing costs. FHA also allows lower credit scores such as 580 and above and they also require at least 12 months of good clean credit. For more information about FHA loans please contact one of our qualified FHA lenders.
                        <br/>VA stands for U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and will finance 100% of the loan. These are available to men and women who are now in the military and to veterans with honorable discharges who meet specific eligibility rules, most of which relate to the length of service. The VA doesnâ€™t make mortgage loans but guarantees part of the house loan you get from a bank, savings, and loans, or another private lender. If you default, the VA pays the lender the amount guaranteed and you, in turn, will owe the VA. This guarantee makes it easier for veterans to get favorable loan terms with a low down payment. For more information please contact one of our VA lenders.
                        <br/>There are also programs available for first-time homebuyers through local state money called the State Bond Money.

                        PMI stands for Private Mortgage Insurance these are policies designed to reimburse a mortgage lender up to a certain amount if you default on your loan and your house isnâ€™t worth enough to entirely repay the lender through a foreclosure sale. Most lenders require PMI on loans where the borrower makes a down payment of less than 20%. For example if you purchase a house for $100,000 and you do not put at least 20% down which amounts to $20,000 the lender will require PMI (private mortgage insurance) and the premium is paid monthly. The fee is typically around one-half of one percent of the mortgage loan. You can cancel the PMI once your equity in the house reaches 20% as long as you have a good monthly mortgage payment history with the lender.

                        A++ Credit is what is known as the best credit rating. With an A++ credit rating you should have no problem getting a house that you qualify for and with A++ credit you will be entitled to the best rate that any mortgage banker, mortgage broker or mortgage lender has to offer so donâ€™t forget to shop for the best rate and do not give out your social security number to just anyone. Find someone you trust. You can go to the following websites to see what your scores are: www.equifax.com, www.transunion.com and the last one is www.experien.com. You can also check out my FICO.com but from our experience, they all charge a fee. You could also try www.freeannualcreditreport.com that is through the Federal Government and they allow you one free credit report per year but be careful because we found that these sites do try to sign you up for a membership with a monthly fee.
